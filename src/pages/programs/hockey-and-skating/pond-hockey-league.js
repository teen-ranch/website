                        Pond Hockey is a year-long development program for boys and girls ages 5-17 years old. There are three levels: Learn to Play, Junior and Senior to accommodate all levels of development. This is not a graduated program, Teen Ranch staff will assess your child and place them in an appropriate level. Don't worry! If your skill level progresses quickly, the coaching staff may move you to the next level. If the level that you are in is too difficult they can accommodate your learning needs in a lower level.
