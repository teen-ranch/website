                <p>So you’re interested in Teen Ranch staff. We’re glad you asked! Teen Ranch is a not-for-profit, Christian summer sports camp and year-round retreat facility. Attracting campers and guests from many backgrounds, we strive to serve them with excellence and thereby earn the right to share our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ with them as God gives opportunity. The task is not an easy one, but one that requires a deep love for the Lord Jesus Christ and an earnest desire to serve Him by serving others.</p>

                <p>Our volunteer/staff family has grown over the years to include people from the ages of 14 to 90. We represent many vocations, come from many backgrounds, and help in many capacities, including:</p>

                <p>Apart from looking great on a resume, a number of past volunteer staff have received financial awards and recognition based on their accumulated high school volunteer hours, not to mention excellent on-the-job leadership training and character development established during those hours.</p>

                <p>Whether we are privileged to have you as part of the Ranch Staff 'family' or should you be directed elsewhere, our prayer is that you will know the love of God "that surpasses knowledge - that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God."</p>
